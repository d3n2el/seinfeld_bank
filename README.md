Do you know seinfeld, well, i do and i decided to make a program inspired to a scene in season 7,episode 24 where seinfeld goes to a bank that will pay you 100$ if you arent greeted with hello(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN6cJ_wGmsk&t=6s), the scene ends with seinfeld agreeing to 20$ since it starts with 20. this project is really simple, the hard part for me its going to be testing the program with pytest
